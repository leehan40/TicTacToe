Tic Tac Toe
by Kevin Leehan

Start page:
You have two options here:
You can either play alone versus the computer "Single Player"
or against a friend "2 Players"

If you tap the screen below the two buttons with every tap a word appears: Tic, Tac, or Toe.

With either game option you select, the user will then be transferred to the game page
The first player to play is X and the 2nd player is O.
When playing against the computer the Human player always goes first.

There is one button visible and located at the bottom left corner of the screen, which allows the user to return to the main screen.
When the game finishes the New Game button will appear at the lower right corner of the screen, allowing the user to start another game.

At anytime the user can press the menu button on the device and select the "Close app" function to exit the app.
